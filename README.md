A short programming assignment from BedeGaming.

Description is as follows:

Implement a very simple game of battleships to allow a single human player to play a
one sided game of battleships against the computer.

random with the following sizes:

● 1x Battleship (5 squares)

● 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The application should accept valid input from the user in the format "A5" to signify
a square to target, and feedback to the user whether the shot was success, and
additionally report on the sinking of any vessels.
